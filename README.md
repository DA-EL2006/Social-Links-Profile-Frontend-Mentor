Social Media Link Profile

A Frontend Mentor challenge to build a responsive social media profile card using HTML and CSS.
The goal was to replicate the reference design as closely as possible while maintaining simplicity and clean structure.

1. Overview

The challenge was to create a social media profile card that displays a profile image, name, location, and several social media links.
The design was implemented using pure HTML and CSS, focusing on layout, alignment, color consistency, and typography.

2. Features

-Centered profile card using Flexbox

-Clean and modern design with consistent spacing

-Rounded avatar image

-Styled social media links

-Simple and accessible layout

3. Technologies Used

-HTML5 – for page structure

-CSS3 (Flexbox) – for layout and styling

4. What I’m Most Proud Of

I’m proud of how neat and well-structured the page looks, and how I was able to replicate the layout accurately using only core web technologies. The centering and spacing turned out well, making the overall design elegant and balanced.

5. What I’d Do Differently Next Time

Next time, I’d:

-Make the design responsive for smaller screens.

-Use relative paths for images to make the project portable.

-Add hover and transition effects for better interactivity.

-Experiment with CSS variables for consistent color and spacing management.
